# Angularapp
Using AngularJS and W3.CSS, I developed an application called "My Family" with the ability to edit data.
For an arbitrary column of the developed application, I developed a filter using the ng-click directive.
In the data editing form of the application, a CSS class was applied to the corresponding input field.
